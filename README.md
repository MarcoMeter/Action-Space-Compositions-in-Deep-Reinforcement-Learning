# Action Spaces in Deep Reinforcement Learning to Mimic Human Input Devices

This repository contributes the environments Shooting Birds and Beastly Rivals Onslaught, which were examined in the underlying paper (headline name).
Hyperparameters can be retrieved from the [config](https://github.com/MarcoMeter/Action-Space-Compositions-in-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/config/trainer_config.yaml).
A video showing the results can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb14i3srRWc&feature=youtu.be).

# Dependencies

This project was created with [Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) v0.7 along with the Unity Engine version 2018.2.20f.
To install the required python packages run:
```
pip install -e /ml-agents/.
pip install tensorflow==1.7.*
```

Checkout the "update" branch if you are looking for project files using more recent dependencies (ml-agents & Unity).
