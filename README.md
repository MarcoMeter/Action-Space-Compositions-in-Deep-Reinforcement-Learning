# Concurrent Discrete and Continuous Actions in Deep Reinforcement Learning

This is the implementation of my master thesis. The source is based on Unity's [ML-Agents toolkit v0.5](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/d6dad11c773a8598540a8896d0d48b2489b222ae). To view the resulted behaviors of the contributed environments, import TensorflowSharp and use an internal brain with one of the provided byte files. The usage of TensorflowShapr is documented [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/d6dad11c773a8598540a8896d0d48b2489b222ae/docs/Using-TensorFlow-Sharp-in-Unity.md).
